Thank you for a great month of weblab! The staff were super helpful and our group learned a lot!

With that being said, here is a list of outside sources that were used in the making of our code: (1) Weblab staff during office hours (2) React Website Tutorial - Beginner React JS Project Fully Responsive: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s [this youtube video was initially used in the creating and design of the navbar as well as the herosection. Since initially implementing this code, much of it has been removed/changed, however, we wanted to be extra careful and give credit where credit is due.]

This prospect pool app harnesses the power that U & I provides by ensuring good matches between organizations and their individuals.
